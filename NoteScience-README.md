# NoteScience

Its litterally just a word processor written badly by an absolute ameteur at python, like seriously, i made the inital commit in one day.
Notescience uses tkinter which i believe is a library for python which helps people like me make stuff like this.
do not download it, it is awful, its simply a wip project im working on whilst procrastinating revising for my exams.
